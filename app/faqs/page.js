                  GCA only occurs in patients 50 years and older. New headaches are common and patients may have pain or
              swelling in the blood vessels around their ears. Other symptoms include face or jaw pain when chewing,

                            If you are a rheumatologist, please contact us and your patient will be contacted shortly. If you are not

                          <h3 className="faq-question">What should I do if my patient has vision changes?</h3>
            <p className="faq-answer">
                            Please send them immediately to the emergency room for evaluation by ophthalmology. They may require IV
              steroids. If the patient is local, please ask them to go to Harborview ER due to availability of ophthalmology.

                          <h3 className="faq-question">Does a negative vascular ultrasound rule out GCA?</h3>
            <p className="faq-answer">
                            A negative vascular ultrasound cannot completely rule out GCA. If a patient has classic signs/symptoms, they
              likely should receive a temporal artery biopsy. Steroids may reduce the changes seen on vascular ultrasound.
